# Ritual Theory: Turner and Durkheim

Victor Turner described ritual as a process of social drama in which participants move from separation through liminality to reintegration.[^1] Emile Durkheim viewed ritual as a collective effervescence that renews social bonds and reaffirms shared values.[^2] Both perspectives highlight ritual's power to create and sustain symbolic coherence.

Turner's concept of "communitas" emphasizes the egalitarian spirit that emerges during liminal phases, while Durkheim focuses on how ritual expresses the sacredness of the social order. Together, these theories offer complementary lenses for understanding how rituals encode cultural norms, manage conflict, and foster group identity.
