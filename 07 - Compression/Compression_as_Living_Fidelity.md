# Compression as Living Fidelity

Life persists by encoding information in compact forms. DNA condenses genetic instructions into nucleotide sequences, enabling reproduction with high fidelity. Human cultures similarly compress survival knowledge into stories, rituals, and technologies. This project explores how compression functions as a strategy for preserving symbolic coherence across generations.

Consider oral epics like the *Iliad*. By embedding moral lessons and historical memory in rhythmic verse, such narratives are easier to remember and transmit. Religious rituals condense cosmological beliefs into gestures and symbols that evoke deep emotional responses. Even modern data compression algorithms mirror this principle, reducing redundancy to save space while retaining meaning.

Understanding compression illuminates why certain myths and practices endure. They offer efficient packets of information that can be re-expanded through performance or interpretation. Recognizing this pattern helps us craft new forms of knowledge transmission that balance brevity with depth.
