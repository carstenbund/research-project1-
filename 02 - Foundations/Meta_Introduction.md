# Foundations Meta-Introduction

This section begins at the most fundamental level: the physical universe. Space, time, and energy are treated not as empty stages but as coherent frameworks that allow complexity to arise. By outlining how physics already exhibits patterned order, we ground the overall thesis that higher symbolic layers must resonate with this basic structure. The following chapters explore key physical ideas, setting up the transition to life and DNA in the next section.
