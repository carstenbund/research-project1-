# Energy Gradients and Complexity

Here we explore how flows of energy create ordered structures, from stars to living cells. Complexity emerges where energy gradients allow for self-organizing processes. This physical principle foreshadows later discussions of life and mind as increasingly intricate forms of coherent organization.
