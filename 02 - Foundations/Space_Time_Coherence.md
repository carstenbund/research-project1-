# Space and Time as Coherence Structures

This brief chapter introduces the idea that the fabric of space and time provides the ground rules for all patterns of coherence. Distances and durations impose limits on how matter and energy interact, which ultimately shapes the emergence of complex order. By considering spacetime as an active framework rather than a neutral background, we set the stage for understanding how higher symbolic layers can arise from physical law.
