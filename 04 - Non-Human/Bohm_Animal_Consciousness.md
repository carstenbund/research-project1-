### Bohm’s Views on Animal Consciousness

Physicist-philosopher **David Bohm** is perhaps best known for his interpretations of quantum mechanics and the idea of an implicate order, but he also mused on the nature of mind and consciousness in ways that extend beyond humans. In various writings and dialogues (including those with Jiddu Krishnamurti), Bohm expressed a view that **mind or mind-like processes are not exclusive to humans** – that some rudimentary form of mentality or proto-consciousness might be present even in simpler life forms, and indeed that *the division between human consciousness and animal consciousness is one of degree, not absolute kind*. Bohm’s holistic philosophy suggested that **all of reality is an undivided wholeness**, and in that wholeness, life and mind are pervasive qualities rather than isolated anomalies.

One of Bohm’s key contentions was that the **same general principles** that underlie human thought – such as the ability to respond to meaning – might be present in other organisms in simpler forms. He noted, for example, that when an animal responds to a sign in its environment (say, a deer hearing a rustle and interpreting it as a possible predator), it is in effect performing a kind of rudimentary symbolic or meaningful response. This indicates a continuity between human symbolic thought and animal signals. In an interview, Bohm speculated that even the **cell** might have a kind of elementary awareness – it perceives chemical gradients and “chooses” responses in a way analogous to how we consciously choose actions (albeit without reflective consciousness). Such ideas echo early 20th-century philosophies of panpsychism or Whitehead’s notion that mentality exists throughout nature in some form. Bohm stopped short of claiming full consciousness for, say, an amoeba, but he entertained that **the precursors of human consciousness (attention, rudimentary thought, intention) are present at all levels of life**.

In his book *Wholeness and the Implicate Order*, Bohm introduced the notion that **thought is a systemic process** and warned against fragmenting mind and matter. While the book focuses on physics and an implicate order where everything is internally related, the implications for consciousness are that *consciousness too could be seen as an unfolding and enfolding process in the universe*. If one accepts that view, it becomes natural to see human consciousness as a *highly evolved form of something more general*. For instance, Bohm was fascinated by how an **flock of birds** moves as if one mind – a coherent behavior emerging from many individuals. He used such examples to illustrate unbroken wholeness in nature. One could interpret that as hinting that the birds collectively manifest a kind of unified awareness (not necessarily one self, but an integrated process). Modern science indeed studies swarm intelligence and collective behavior, sometimes drawing parallels to cognitive processes.

In dialogues with biologist Rupert Sheldrake and others, Bohm discussed **intelligence in nature**, pondering if evolution might involve a non-local mind-like field guiding forms (Sheldrake’s morphogenetic fields idea). Bohm’s own physics-based intuitions made him open to the possibility that **mind and life are intimately woven into the fabric of reality**, rather than being late emergent anomalies. This aligns with his famous quote that “matter and consciousness are not in separate categories… rather, they are different aspects of the one whole reality” (paraphrasing). Thus, when considering animals, Bohm saw no reason to create a sharp cutoff at humans. If wholeness underlies all, then **animals participate in the same holistic reality**, likely possessing their own mode of inner life.

Practically, what might Bohm say about, say, a dog’s consciousness? He might emphasize that while a dog doesn’t think in abstractions or language as we do, it can still **have meanings**. The smell of its owner carries meaning and triggers joyful response; it has intentions (like wanting to play or to guard). These are the building blocks of what we have in more complex form. In one dialogue, Bohm and Krishnamurti explored whether the human mind, which has self-reflective consciousness, is fundamentally different or just an enriched continuity of the animal mind. They leaned toward continuity – suggesting that *if we strip away our verbal thought, something like the animal’s perceptual-intuitive mode remains*.

Bohm also believed in **learning from nature’s intelligence**. He pointed out how, for instance, our social problems often arise from rigid fragmentary thought, whereas nature’s systems (including animal societies) often find dynamic balance. He saw this as a form of intelligence we have yet to emulate. This viewpoint implicitly credits animals and ecosystems with a kind of wisdom – not wisdom in conceptual thought, but in *harmonious functional order*, which Bohm might say hints at an underlying mind-like quality in all matter.

In modern terms, some of Bohm’s musings resonate with the idea of **gradations of consciousness** across the animal kingdom, which is taken seriously by many neuroscientists today. The neuroscience of consciousness has provided evidence that mammals, birds, and even octopuses have sophisticated neural processes that correlate with conscious-like behaviors (problem solving, play, forming concepts). Bohm anticipated such a perspective by philosophically extending consciousness beyond the human.

To tie Bohm’s view into our theme: if consciousness is recursive symbolic coherence, one could argue that **animals exhibit simpler forms of recursive coherence**. They have perceptions and memories that feed back into their present behavior (a dog remembers being scolded when it sees similar context and alters action – a simple recursive learning loop). They might not have complex symbol systems like language, but they have **signs and signals** (bird songs, bee dances). Interestingly, Bohm commented on the dance of bees (how bees communicate location of flowers via waggle dance) as a remarkable example of nature’s communication system, arguably symbolic (the dance encodes direction and distance). It suggests bees have a “language” of their own – strongly implying a mind capable of using symbolic-like reference, thus a degree of consciousness.

In summary, Bohm’s outlook erases the stark line between human and animal minds. He offers a vision where **the universe is pervaded with mind-like processes**, and human consciousness is a high expression of principles that run through simpler organisms and even inorganic matter in some form. It’s a deeply holistic, almost spiritual scientific perspective. By including his views, we expand our consideration of recursive symbolic coherence to ask: might the *roots* of our symbol-driven consciousness lie deep in the evolutionary tree, visible in the behaviors and perhaps inner lives of animals? Bohm would likely nod in agreement, hinting that understanding animal consciousness is part of understanding consciousness at large – a continuum in the implicate order of reality.
