# Bohm on Animal Consciousness

Physicist David Bohm speculated that mind-like qualities may pervade nature. In his dialogues with biologist Rupert Sheldrake, Bohm suggested that animal consciousness could reflect subtler orders of the same holistic processes seen in quantum mechanics.[^1] He wrote, "In some sense, a rudimentary form of consciousness is present in all matter."[^2]

Modern comparative cognition supports the idea that many animals exhibit problem-solving, empathy, and communication skills. Studies of corvids and primates reveal complex social learning and tool use. Bohm's holistic framework resonates with these findings, emphasizing the continuity between human and non-human minds.

While controversial, Bohmâ€™s views invite us to reconsider rigid boundaries between species. If consciousness arises from underlying implicate orders, then animal cognition may represent different degrees of unfolding rather than fundamentally separate phenomena. This perspective encourages ethical reflection on how we treat other beings within the broader web of life.
