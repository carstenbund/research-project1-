### Neuroplasticity and Symbolic Learning

Human brains are remarkably malleable. **Neuroplasticity** refers to the brain’s ability to change its structure and function in response to experience and learning. In essence, neurons forge new connections or strengthen existing ones when we encounter new tasks, environments, or ideas. This plasticity underlies all learning and memory. A classic neuroscientific adage captures it well: “**Neurons that fire together, wire together**,” meaning that repeated simultaneous activation of neural circuits leads to lasting synaptic strengthening. Through such Hebbian plasticity, our experiences literally reshape our neural networks over time, much like repeated foot traffic will carve a path in grass.

One powerful aspect of human neuroplasticity is our capacity for **symbolic learning** – acquiring language, art, mathematics, and other symbol systems. Learning to read, for example, induces measurable changes in brain anatomy and connectivity. Studies show that adults who learn to read (after being illiterate) develop increased gray matter density in language-related areas (like the angular gyrus) and stronger white-matter connections between hemispheres. After literacy training, the structural differences between new readers and long-time readers diminish as the brain’s circuitry adapts. Similarly, becoming bilingual alters the brain: bilingual individuals show **increased gray matter in the inferior parietal cortex**, a key language region, reflecting the brain’s adaptation to juggling two languages. In short, the brain **compresses experience into symbols** by reorganizing itself – dedicating specialized regions to process written characters, symbols, or second-language vocabulary. The fact that such changes are observed highlights that symbolic learning isn’t just abstract; it’s imprinted in flesh and blood.

**Affect (emotion) plays a crucial role** in this learning process. When information carries emotional weight, it tends to “stick” in memory more strongly. Neuroplastic changes are amplified by emotional arousal – for instance, the amygdala (an emotion-processing region) can tag experiences as important, thereby boosting the brain’s encoding of those experiences into long-term memory. We will delve deeper into this “affective tagging” in a later section, but even here we can say: the brain’s plasticity is not a cold mechanical process; it is guided by what matters to us. An analogy is that the brain is like a muscle that grows with use, but **which exercises we practice is determined by our interests and emotions**. A child fascinated by music will literally reshape their auditory and motor cortices through joyful practice, encoding complex musical symbols (notes, rhythms) into their neural fabric. Through repeated culturally meaningful practice (be it language, art, or ritual), our brains compress vast experiences into symbolic forms – neural shorthand that we can later expand again in imagination or communication.

Finally, neuroplasticity demonstrates the **recursive** nature of learning: as we acquire new symbols (words, notations, concepts), we use them to think about and learn even more. The symbols become part of our mental repertoire and enable further learning – a positive feedback loop. For example, learning mathematical symbols enables new calculations, which in turn modifies the brain’s problem-solving networks. This recursion between **symbol acquisition and brain change** is continuous throughout life. Our brains remain plastic, albeit less so in adulthood than childhood, which means we continually update the neural “code” that represents our world. Over decades, an individual who avidly studies – say, philosophy – will have built rich symbolic networks in the brain, networks that make new philosophical ideas easier to grasp. In this way, **neuroplasticity is the enabler of symbolic coherence**: it ensures our brain can adapt to encode the symbolic patterns that form the content of our consciousness, and reshape itself as those patterns grow more complex and interlinked. This sets the stage for understanding how our sense of self and reality can be seen as an ongoing, self-adjusting web of symbols.

Neuroscientist **David Eagleman** emphasizes that the brain is "**livewired**" rather than fixed. In his work on sensory substitution devices, Eagleman demonstrates that areas of the adult brain can be repurposed to process entirely new streams of information. For instance, tactile vests that convert sound into patterns of vibration show that auditory regions can adapt to input delivered through touch. Such findings reveal plasticity far beyond childhood and illustrate the brain’s capacity to adapt to technologies or environments it never encountered during evolution.

This flexibility suggests that a child born **thirty thousand years ago** would be just as capable of mastering modern knowledge if raised in today’s society. Researchers like **Michael Merzenich** and **Norman Doidge** highlight how cultural experiences sculpt cortical maps: the genetic brain provides a scaffold, but experience “programs” it with specialized skills. Under modern educational scaffolding, ancient humans could develop the same high-level symbolic reasoning – even becoming neuroscientists themselves – because neuroplasticity fills in the details demanded by the environment.
