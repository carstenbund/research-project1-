# Recursive Ontology of Consciousness

This overview sketches a set of axioms describing consciousness as recursive symbolic coherence. Each axiom builds on the previous, offering a conceptual framework for integrating neuroscience, culture, and metaphysics.

## Axiom 1: Embodied Recursion
Conscious experience arises from feedback loops between sensory input and motor output. The body is not merely a vessel but an active participant in shaping perception.[^1]

## Axiom 2: Symbolic Compression
Brains and cultures compress information into symbols for efficient storage and communication. These symbols can be re-expanded through interpretation, allowing complex ideas to persist across contexts.[^2]

## Axiom 3: Affective Tagging
Emotions mark symbols with salience, guiding attention and memory. Affective tags help maintain coherence by prioritizing meaningful patterns.[^3]

## Axiom 4: Holistic Emergence
Individual minds are local manifestations of a larger field of relationships. Consciousness emerges from interactions among neural, social, and environmental systems, echoing Bohm's implicate order.

These axioms invite exploration rather than closure. They form a scaffold for further investigation into how recursive processes sustain the tapestry of experience.
