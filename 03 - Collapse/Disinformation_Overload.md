### Disinformation and Algorithmic Overload

In the digital age, we face a new challenge to symbolic coherence: a deluge of information (and misinformation) unprecedented in human history. **Disinformation ecosystems** – networks of intentionally false or misleading information – and **information overload** through algorithmic feeds threaten to overwhelm our cognitive capacity to construct a coherent worldview. The symbolic loops that constitute our consciousness can become hijacked or jammed by these forces, leading to fragmentation of shared reality and personal sense-making.

One major issue is that our brains evolved in environments of information scarcity (tribal settings, slow-changing news), but today we exist in environments of information abundance (24/7 news cycles, social media, infinite content). There is a **mismatch**: we are flooded with far more symbolic input (words, images, narratives) than we can adequately integrate. This can lead to a kind of **symbolic overload** where coherence breaks down – we cannot form a stable narrative because inputs keep coming and contradicting each other. The feeling of scanning a social media timeline – hundreds of disconnected micro-stories, emotional stimuli, facts and quasi-facts – can leave one feeling scattered and anxious. In our terms, the recursive symbolic loop is overclocked and cluttered; instead of depth of understanding, we skim along the surface of an unending feed. Researchers in media studies note that constant information switching impairs the consolidation of memory and meaning, creating a state of continuous partial attention.

Disinformation worsens this by introducing **noise into the system intentionally**. For example, during a public health crisis, credible experts might share a clear symbolic message (“this virus is real and dangerous”), but disinformation agents flood the infosphere with alternate symbols (conspiracy theories, fake cures, denialist claims). When individuals encounter these clashing narratives, their symbolic coherence – their internal “sense of what is true” – can degrade. Some may form completely alternate symbolic realities (e.g. adherents of a flat earth theory or QAnon). What’s key is that disinformation usually works not by creating a *coherent alternative* (often those narratives are internally inconsistent or fantastical), but by **fragmenting trust and consensus**. It seeds doubt: “you can’t know what’s true, everything might be a lie.” This epistemic nihilism is itself a sort of collapse in coherence, because a person in that state may latch onto purely emotional or identity-driven symbols (like a charismatic leader’s assertions) rather than any shared standard of truth. In effect, disinformation can **rewire the affective tagging** mechanism – making certain false symbols emotionally salient so they stick despite contradiction by evidence.

Algorithms on platforms like YouTube, Facebook, etc., can unintentionally contribute to these problems. They are designed to maximize engagement, which often means showing users more of what emotionally provokes them (the outrageous, the sensational). Over time, a person’s online environment can become an **echo chamber** – a tightly bound symbolic bubble that reinforces specific beliefs and filters out opposing views. Within such a chamber, local coherence may be strong (everything you see aligns with your belief X), but it can be **globally incoherent** relative to wider reality (belief X might be entirely false or one-sided). The result is a fracturing of collective symbolic coherence: instead of a society broadly sharing one reality with minor variations, you get siloed mini-realities. This is a modern epistemic crisis. As one analyst noted, *the proliferation of divergent narratives means not just disagreement on values, but disagreement on basic facts – a dangerous state where dialog becomes nearly impossible*.

An example of algorithmic overload’s effect: During an election, a user who clicks on one conspiracy video might be recommended increasingly extreme content, leading them down a “rabbit hole.” After weeks, their mental model of the political reality might be completely different from that of a neighbor who consumes only mainstream news. Both individuals feel confident in their views, but their symbolic reference frames share almost no common ground. In this scenario, even language loses shared meaning – terms like “freedom” or “justice” get reinterpreted within each bubble’s context, heightening polarization. We see then how **information overload + disinformation = breakdown in shared symbolic coherence**.

Furthermore, **cognitive overload** itself reduces critical thinking. Studies show that when people are bombarded with too many pieces of information, they resort to heuristics or emotional reasoning to decide what to believe. Disinformers exploit this by creating *firehoses of falsehood* (releasing such volume and variety of claims that the average person cannot debunk or even parse them all). In a state of fatigue or confusion, individuals might simply choose to believe the narrative that *feels* right for them (often aligning with pre-existing biases or group identities). This is a reversion to coherence-by-tribe: “It’s too complex to know the truth, so I’ll just stick with the story my community endorses.” It’s a defensive coherence that deepens social divides.

From our framework’s perspective, what’s happening is that the **recursive loop of understanding** is short-circuited. Instead of careful reflection (where one’s beliefs are updated by integrating new evidence consistently), many are caught in a loop where new inputs either get ignored or force-fit into an existing narrative regardless of accuracy. The self-correcting aspect of symbolic recursion (ideally, noticing contradictions and resolving them) fails under these conditions. Thus, false or irrational beliefs can become **remarkably resistant to correction** – a phenomenon observed widely, where presenting factual refutations sometimes even *strengthens* the false belief (a backfire effect). This shows that when coherence is threatened, people often double down on whichever symbolic structure they have, rather than face the dissonance. In essence, **maintaining a sense of coherence (even a false one) can trump the quest for truth** when individuals feel epistemically overwhelmed.

Addressing this modern challenge likely requires new “cognitive immune systems” at both individual and collective levels: better critical thinking education (so interpretants can be examined critically), better platform design (to reduce reward for sensational disinformation), and robust fact-checking norms integrated into social systems. It is a race to ensure our symbolic environment remains navigable and not a hall of mirrors. The stakes are high – when shared reality falls apart, societies can descend into factionalism and conflict, akin to an epistemic civil war.

In conclusion, disinformation and information overload can be seen as stress tests on the coherence of our symbolic worlds. They flood the recursive loops of consciousness with either junk input or simply too much input, risking a collapse of meaning similar to historical epistemic crises but on a potentially global scale. Our theory underscores that consciousness and culture strive for coherence; recognizing these threats allows us to defend that coherence by consciously managing attention, curating healthier information diets, and building technologies and institutions that favor truth over virality. Keeping our collective symbolic loops sane and stable may well be one of the defining challenges of 21st-century consciousness.
