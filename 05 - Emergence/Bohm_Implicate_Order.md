### Bohm's Implicate and Explicate Order

One of the most intriguing perspectives on reality and consciousness comes from David Bohm’s theory of the **implicate and explicate order**. Bohm proposed that what we normally see as reality – discrete objects, particles, individuals – is actually an **explicate order**, a kind of unfolded outcome of a deeper, underlying **implicate order** (an enfolded, holistic domain). In the implicate order, everything is fundamentally interconnected; separation is an illusion that emerges only when the implicate order unfolds into the explicate. This idea was inspired by quantum physics (e.g. the entanglement of particles suggests a wholeness not captured by classical separateness) and by Bohm’s interpretation of quantum processes as dynamic holisms. **His interpretation remains speculative and is not part of mainstream physics.**

To grasp this with an analogy, Bohm often used the image of a **hologram**. A hologram plate has interference patterns (implicate order) that don’t look like the image at all, yet when properly illuminated (unfolded), the image (explicate order) appears. Moreover, every part of the hologram contains the whole image (albeit at lower resolution). Similarly, in Bohm’s view, the entire universe in some way is enfolded in each region – the implicate order is a holographic information realm, and what we experience (space, time, separate entities) is a particular unfolding from it.

In terms of consciousness, Bohm speculated that **mind and matter both arise from the implicate order**. He didn’t rigidly separate the two; rather, he saw them as different aspects of the one whole. Conscious processes could be seen as **enfolding and unfolding information** in a way analogous to how physical processes do. He introduced the notion of a *"holomovement"* – the dynamic activity of the whole – to emphasize that nothing is static; the implicate order is in constant flux, and the explicate is continually generated from it.

To illustrate implicate vs explicate, Bohm gave examples like ink droplets in glycerine. If you have a cylinder of viscous fluid and put in a drop of ink, then slowly turn the cylinder, the ink thread stretches and “disappears” – it’s smeared out microscopically (enfolded into the fluid). Yet if you reverse the rotation, the droplet reappears (unfolds). The information of the droplet was not lost, just hidden (implicate). This demo shows how information can be enfolded in apparently diffuse forms and then reconstituted.

Now, how does this relate to consciousness? Bohm suggested that our brains might work by encoding information in an implicate way and then making specific thoughts explicate. He even speculated about the brain’s structure (with its vast interconnections and possibly holographic-like memory storage as suggested by Pribram) as suited for such processing. More broadly, he entertained that *consciousness could be a more subtle level of reality, perhaps a more implicate order beyond our physical explicate order*. In that sense, consciousness isn’t produced by neurons like a factory output; rather, neurons are like receivers that tune into or unfold the implicate order where mind resides.

This resonates with certain interpretations of quantum mechanics where observation and information seem fundamental. Bohm’s famous example: *if you drop a pebble in a pond, classical physics sees ripples spreading (explicate effect), but implicately, one could think of the entire pond “knowing” the pebble fell in by a reconfiguration of the whole field.*

In *Wholeness and the Implicate Order*, Bohm wrote, “In the implicate order, space and time are no longer the dominant factors determining the relationships of dependence or independence of different elements. Instead, an entirely different sort of connection of elements is possible.” In consciousness, this could be linked to how thoughts far apart in time or space can suddenly connect (as in intuition or creativity). Bohm might say that’s because in the implicate domain of mind, those ideas were never separate – they were part of a whole and just unfolded together into your awareness in that moment of insight.

Bohm’s theory also included the concept of “**active information**.” He used this to describe how form can guide process without exerting force – like a radio wave (information) guiding a ship via a pilot signal, or a DNA molecule guiding protein construction. Active information is information that *has a causal efficacy by virtue of its form*. In quantum terms, he associated this with the quantum potential guiding electrons in the double-slit experiment. One can draw a parallel to consciousness: perhaps our mental intentions act as active information on the physical brain, or vice versa, the brain’s processes imbue active information into a mental realm.

To provide a **direct quote from Bohm** demonstrating his ideas: In an interview Bohm said, *“**Each person enfolds something of the spirit of the other in his consciousness.**”*, suggesting that within each of us is an enfoldment of others, which in dialogue can unfold. And from *Wholeness...*, *“**We have to learn to view everything as part of an undivided whole, instead of isolating parts and looking at how they interact.**”*

Bringing this back to **symbolic coherence**: one way to interpret implicate order in our context is to consider that the **coherence of consciousness might stem from an underlying wholeness**. Our symbols and thoughts feel loosely connected sometimes, but there is an undeniable unity to our conscious experience – perhaps an imprint of an implicate order within the mind. Bohm’s implicate order offers a conceptual way to think about how *disparate elements can be unified without classical links*, which might apply to holistic features of consciousness (like the sense of self, or the binding problem of how perceptions unify).

Moreover, if implicate order is real, then **consciousness could be more than just neurons – it could be a process in the fabric of reality itself**, manifesting in us. That dovetails with ideas in panpsychism or neutral monism, but Bohm gives it a unique quantum-mechanical flavor.

In summary, Bohm’s implicate and explicate orders provide a profound re-visioning of reality as an unbroken whole in process. For our study, it contributes the notion that *coherence might originate from holism*. The universe is not a collection of separate parts interacting; it’s an unfolding whole. Consciousness, being part of the universe, might operate on the same principle. When we have a coherent thought or a sudden insight linking far-flung ideas, perhaps we are glimpsing the implicate. In any case, Bohm’s ideas challenge us to think beyond classical fragmentation and entertain that the unity we feel in consciousness mirrors a deeper unity in nature. It’s a reminder that our quest to understand mind may require a paradigm shift as radical as his in physics.
