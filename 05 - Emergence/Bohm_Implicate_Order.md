# Bohm's Implicate and Explicate Order

David Bohm proposed that reality unfolds from an "implicate order," a deeper level where all phenomena are interconnected. The "explicate order" is the manifest world we observe, arising from the constant enfolding and unfolding of this underlying reality.[^1] Bohm compared the process to a hologram: each fragment contains the whole pattern, and the whole emerges from coherent interference.

Central to this view is the holomovement, a dynamic flow that unites mind and matter. Bohm wrote, "Space is not empty. It is full, a plenum as opposed to a vacuum," emphasizing that particles are just ripples in a vast energetic sea.[^2] This holistic perspective challenges classical notions of separateness, suggesting that consciousness is woven into the fabric of the universe.

Analogies help ground these abstractions. Imagine a river whose eddies appear distinct yet are inseparable from the water's flow. Similarly, individual minds may be seen as localized patterns within a universal movement. Modern physics explores related ideas through quantum entanglement and nonlocal correlations, though Bohm's interpretation remains speculative.
