# Observer-Dependence and Quantum Collapse

Quantum physics reveals that the act of measurement affects the state of a system. The double-slit experiment famously shows particles behaving as waves until observed, when their probabilities "collapse" into definite positions. This phenomenon raises questions about the role of consciousness in physical processes.[^1]

One interpretation invokes decoherence: interactions with the environment effectively measure particles, removing quantum superpositions without requiring a conscious observer. Yet the measurement problem persists, challenging our understanding of objective reality. Some physicists propose that observation is an entanglement event, where the observer becomes part of the system's state.[^2]

These debates highlight a philosophical tension: is reality fundamentally observer-dependent? While mainstream physics treats consciousness as epiphenomenal, others, drawing on Bohm or Wheeler, argue that observers participate in shaping the universe. Regardless of stance, quantum collapse underscores the interdependence of knowledge and observation, echoing themes of recursive symbolic coherence.
