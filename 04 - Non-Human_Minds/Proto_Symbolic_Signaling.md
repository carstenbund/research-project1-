### Proto-Symbolic Signaling

Long before humans developed language and writing, the natural world was already buzzing with **proto-symbolic communication**. By "proto-symbolic," we mean signaling behaviors in non-human species that share some features with symbolic language, even if they lack the full complexity and grammar of human language. These are systems of signs that convey meaning between members of a species (and sometimes across species). Studying these can illuminate the evolutionary precursors of our own symbolic capacity and reinforce the idea that *symbolic coherence has deep biological roots*.

A clear example is the **honeybee waggle dance**. When a foraging honeybee discovers a rich source of nectar, it returns to the hive and performs a specific dance on the honeycomb. The dance involves waggling its abdomen while running in a particular direction and doing loops. Amazingly, the **angle of the waggle run relative to vertical communicates the direction of the food relative to the sun**, and the duration of the waggle phase communicates the distance. Here we have a non-human animal using a *conventionalized code* to represent spatial information – essentially a symbolic map. Other bees interpret this dance (the “sign-vehicle”) and as a result fly off in the indicated direction and distance to find the flowers (the “object”). In Peircean terms, there is a sign (the dance pattern), an object (the location of flowers), and interpretants (the other bees’ understanding which triggers correct navigation). While bees likely do this by instinct rather than learned convention, it functions remarkably like a language. This is a prime case of proto-symbolic signaling: abstract information is conveyed (not just an emotional state or presence of something, but a precise navigational instruction).

Another example is found in **vervet monkeys’ alarm calls**. Vervet monkeys have at least three distinct alarm calls for different predators: one for leopards, one for eagles, one for snakes. Upon hearing a certain call, other vervets respond appropriately: for an eagle alarm, they look up and run for cover; for a leopard alarm, they climb into trees; for a snake, they stand on two legs and scan the ground. These calls are *arbitrary sounds* with specific meanings – akin to words for “eagle,” “leopard,” “snake.” Young vervets must even learn to use them correctly; infants sometimes give eagle alarms for any bird until they learn the proper context. So, we see **reference and learning** in this animal communication system. It’s not grammar-heavy, but it shows discrete units of sound mapping consistently to categories of danger – a basic symbolic function.

Birdsong can also be proto-symbolic. Some songbirds have regional “dialects,” and specific patterns can signal aggression or mating availability. A nightingale’s complex song might not *refer* to external objects, but it encodes information about the singer’s fitness, identity, and territory. In a way, it’s symbolic in that it stands for the bird’s presence and prowess to others who “interpret” it. The rich, structured sequence of notes might be seen as analogous to a sequence of symbols (notes as letters forming musical “phrases”). While the meaning is more emotional/biological than referential (“I am here, I’m strong, stay away” or “I’m looking for a mate”), it’s a form of consistent encoding and decoding of messages.

Moving beyond vertebrates, consider cuttlefish and octopuses that use rapid skin color changes to communicate mood or intent (camouflage vs. bright warnings vs. courting displays). While often these signals are iconic or indexical (a threatening pattern might make the animal look bigger – iconic of danger), some patterns are arbitrary but understood within the species. They have a quasi-language of patterns.

Also fascinating are **prairie dog calls** which studies suggest may encode surprisingly detailed information. Researchers (Slobodchikoff et al.) found that prairie dogs have different calls that can indicate not only predator type, but even qualities like color or shape of a human intruder (for instance, distinguishing a tall human in a blue shirt from a short human in yellow). If true, that implies an ability to form and communicate composite descriptions – definitely a proto-symbolic trait edging towards syntactic structure.

These examples show that the **gap between human language and animal signaling is bridged by many intermediate forms**. They likely lack open-ended combinatorial syntax (no animal is writing poetry or scientific papers), but they share the **fundamental aspect of a symbol: a perceivable act that conveys meaning to others**. In animals, meaning usually revolves around survival and reproduction (food, danger, mate attraction, social bonding). But that’s likely how human language started too. Our cave ancestors’ first words were probably about things like “water,” “bison,” or signals like “come” or “stop.” Over evolutionary time, and especially with an increase in brain size and social complexity, these proto-symbols became more numerous and started combining, leading to true grammar and infinite expressivity.

The notion of **recursion** – a key part of our theory – might be nascent in some animal communications. For instance, some songbirds can embed phrases within phrases or have hierarchical song structure (a form of recursion in sound). Dolphins and whales have complex calls that sometimes show repeated motifs and variations, hinting at structural rules. It’s not proven that any non-human naturally uses recursive syntax like human sentences (Noam Chomsky famously argued recursion is the unique hallmark of human language), but we see glimmers: a gibbon’s song may layer different notes to indicate both predator type and urgency, a bit like modifying a call with an extra element for intensity (analogous to adding an adjective).

Studying proto-symbolic signaling supports the idea that **symbolic coherence (meaningful signal systems)** did not suddenly pop into existence with humans out of nowhere, but evolved gradually. This suggests that consciousness, as we frame it (recursive symbolic coherence), also has evolutionary roots. A chimpanzee has a less elaborate symbolic loop, but still can remember past events, anticipate the future, and perhaps combine simple signs (some chimps taught sign language can form two-word phrases like “give banana”). So, in their own way, non-humans also *construct a coherent reality through the signs available to them*.

Furthermore, recognizing symbolic traits in animals encourages us to refine our definition of consciousness. If a bee dance encodes and conveys knowledge, do we consider the hive as having a kind of collective consciousness of its environment? Some thinkers propose exactly that – a hive mind concept. It may not be consciousness as we introspect, but it’s a coherent information system integrating perception, memory (the dances change if flowers are gone, indicating update of info), and communication – which mirrors elements of what we consider consciousness (perceiving, remembering, communicating intentionally).

In conclusion, the animal kingdom provides a rich tapestry of proto-symbolic systems that prefigure our own. These highlight continuity and also underscore what is special about human symbols (we took it much farther: syntax, abstraction, creativity). But seeing the seeds in other species’ signals helps us appreciate consciousness as an evolving property. It wasn’t granted in full to homo sapiens by magic; it grew from simpler capacities that were advantageous: to warn kin, to coordinate, to share where food is, to woo a mate with a song. **Symbolic coherence begins wherever information is shared and retained for guiding behavior** – even the dance of a bee fits that bill. By acknowledging proto-symbolic signaling, we place human consciousness firmly in the natural world’s progression, strengthening a key theme: mind is not an island, but part of a spectrum of meaning-making in life.
